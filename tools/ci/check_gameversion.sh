# Fails when a PR reuses a GameVersion the base branch has ALREADY spent for a
# DIFFERENT rule.
#
# Why this exists: a GameVersion is claimed across BRANCHES, and nothing else in
# the build enforces that. Two branches can each be perfectly current with main
# and still pick the same next number, because neither can see the other's
# choice. The collision then lands silently, and a replay's recorded version no
# longer identifies the rules that produced it — the replay still LOADS (the
# version string matches) and then re-simulates wrong, which is worse than a
# refusal. See AGENTS.md, "A GameVersion number is claimed across BRANCHES".
#
# The non-obvious part: comparing the NUMBER cannot detect the collision,
# because the colliding branch and the base BOTH read e.g. "42". What
# distinguishes them is the RULE the number is attached to — the headline on the
# changelog comment. So: same number + different rule headline = two meanings
# for one version = fail.
#
# Usage:
#   tools/ci/check_gameversion.sh <base-ref> [head-ref]
# Examples:
#   tools/ci/check_gameversion.sh origin/main            # check working HEAD
#   tools/ci/check_gameversion.sh origin/main my-branch  # check a branch
#
# Exit 0 = fine, exit 1 = collision (or the branch is behind its base).
